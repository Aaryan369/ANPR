Automatic Number Plate Recognition 

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and read license plate numbers of vehicles. The main goal of this technology is to automate the process of toll collection and improve the efficiency of traffic management.

One of the traditional methods of toll collection is using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags. While this method has improved the process, there are still many drawbacks. RFID readers take time to read and process the ID tags, which leads to long wait times at the toll gates. Furthermore, RFID tags can be lost or damaged, which leads to additional costs for the vehicle owners.

To tackle these issues, ANPR technology is being implemented to speed up the process of toll collection. This technology uses a camera placed near the toll gate to capture images of the license plates of vehicles. These images are then processed using computer vision techniques such as OpenCV to isolate the license plate from the rest of the image. The license plate number is then sent to a deep learning model, which is trained to recognize the characters on the license plate and extract the license number.

Once the license number is recognized, the system fetches the details of the vehicle owner from a MongoDB database using the license number. This information is then used to deduct the proper toll fee from the owner's bank account. The process of using a camera to capture and recognize the license plate number reduces the time lag caused by RFID readers in reading and processing the ID tags.

In summary, ANPR technology uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate the process of toll collection. It improves the efficiency of traffic management by reducing the wait times at toll gates and eliminates the need for RFID tags. The use of a deep learning model to recognize the license plate number and fetching the details of the vehicle owner from a MongoDB database further improves the automation of the process. With the increasing advancements in AI and CV, ANPR technology has a great potential to revolutionize the way we manage traffic and make our lives easier.
