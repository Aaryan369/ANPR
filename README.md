Automatic Number Plate Recognition 

To tackle the issue of long wait times at the toll gates new methods are being implemented to speed up the process of toll collection. One such method is by using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags. While this method has sped up the process, there are still a lot of drawbacks.

With the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision we can automate this task by setting up a camera near toll gate which can isolate the car's license plate and process it using OpenCV. This is then sent to a Deep learning model to identify the license number from the image. This number is then recorded and proper amount is cut from the owner's bank account.The process of using a camera might reduce the time lag caused by the Rfid readers in reading and processing the ID tags.
